# Conclusions and Recommendations
+ The company generated a total of 30.82 MILLION between 2018 and 2020
+ Milo was the best selling product as it generated the highest revenue within the period and it also has the best sales trend amongst the products
+ Monthly sales trend revealed that sales increased in 2019 but later dropped in  2020, this might be due to the covid-19 pandemic
+ South Australia happen to be the country where the most revenue is been generated while western australia generates the least
+ It was also observed that sales dwindle after october every year then picks up by january
+ The direct sales medium is the most used medium and it also generates the most revenue

## Recommendation
+ The sales team should investigate into the low performing products and try to find stretegies to boost their performance
+ The sales team should also investigate into the reason for the dwindling in sales in last 2 months of the year
+ Since the direct medium seem to be most used, the manager should capitalize and make the most out of it.
